                                        technology at its core. Quorum maintains a common
                                        ledger that can only be updated, block after block, by
                                        the network consensus that members provide. Each
                                        Brand Stack has to manage at least two Quorum nodes and ensure their liveness.
                                        This blockchain network is completed by the centralized applications part: Blockchain services that allow the connection between the blockchain and other applications.
                                        Off-chain services including APIs used to connect business services to the Platform.

                                        Using Blockchain to Enhance Luxury Supply Chain Traceability.
                                        Blockchain introduces a shared ledger that can be used as a real-time source of fact between parties in the supply chain. Assets, which could include inventory or credit notes,for instance,are represented on the blockchain to facilitate transactions between parties. RFID tags,NFC chips or QR codes can make the connection to physical assets where needed.
                                        Luxury brands can realize substantial benefits from joining a dedicated supply chain network like Luxury Guarantee. Thanks to a shared, real-time point of truth,blockchain reduces operational errors like missing stock or wrong inventory data.
